# Processing
Processing is a programming language very useful for visual arts, one of the things I find most interesting about it it's generative art. This repository is an example of things you can do with it.

Back in university I made a video about how code can help artist make art, in Processing the bond between scientific computation and arts is very thin, two not so different areas, arts and computing can interact betwen them to make astonishing creations and pieces of art who deliver a message. You can see that video in spanish on this link: https://youtu.be/-qz3oLhy9nc , the process of scientific dissemination I encounter in this project was very entretaining and I hope other people find it as interesting and beautiful as I did.
